# SOHO_NETWORK_PROJECTS

This repository contains SOHO network setups created in Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to demonstrate skills in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting. Each project is organized into separate branches, with configurations tailored to simulate real-world small office and home office environments. Projects include setups for efficient network segmentation, dynamic addressing, and basic security features. Each branch provides detailed documentation, configuration files, and visual topology diagrams in Packet Tracer to help illustrate key concepts and best practices in networking. Explore individual branches to review specific setups, techniques, and configurations.
